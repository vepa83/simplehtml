This website is for inCodeClub. We are a free International Code Club formed with the purpose of growing as Fullstack Web Developers and helping new coders to do the same. This is done by taking on volunteer projects with the purpose of building Web and Mobile Applications to assist individuals and small companies.
Thanks,
